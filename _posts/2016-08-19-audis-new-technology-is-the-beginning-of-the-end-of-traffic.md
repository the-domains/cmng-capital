  Audi has announced it is rolling out a feature in some of its new vehicles
  that allows them to communicate with traffic lights. It's a neat trick that
  customers might like: they can watch as a timer counts down until a red light
  turns green, or the system can warn drivers approaching a green light that
  it's going to change, and advise them to start braking.

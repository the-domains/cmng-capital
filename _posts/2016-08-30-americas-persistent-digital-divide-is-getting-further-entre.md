  It's hard enough to get an Internet connection in some parts of America. But
  recent court judgments could halt a series of initiatives that were slowly
  taking broadband to poor and remote areas. Around the U.S., many cities have
  established their own broadband schemes to provide high-speed Internet access
  in areas where commercial providers have yet to offer a competitive service.

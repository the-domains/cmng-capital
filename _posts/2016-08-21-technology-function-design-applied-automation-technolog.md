  The boundaries between architecture (design) and building technology
  (configuration) are now so fluid that a new design philosophy for buildings is
  required. Modern information technology is developing extremely fast and the
  requirements for integrating this new technology successfully into today's
  planning and building processes are constantly increasing.

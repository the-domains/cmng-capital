  To build a city from scratch, create a solid economic foundation. Three
  millennia ago, Akhenaten began construction of the Egyptian city of
  Amarna-perhaps the first example of planned urban infrastructure in recorded
  history. Within a decade of Akhenaten's death, Amarna was abandoned-ancient
  evidence that building infrastructure and convincing people to use it are two
  fundamentally different challenges.

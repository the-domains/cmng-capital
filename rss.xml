            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Technology - Function - Design. Applied automation technology in the DIAL building.</h1><p>The boundaries between architecture (design) and building technology (configuration) are now so fluid that a new design philosophy for buildings is required. Modern information technology is developing extremely fast and the requirements for integrating this new technology successfully into today's planning and building processes are constantly increasing.</p><img src="https://www.dial.de/fileadmin/images/blog/_processed_/csm_Applied-automation-technology-in-the-DIAL-building_941ad33d30.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google Fiber is on hold as the future of blazing Internet turns toward wireless tech</h1><p>Laying fiber is, it turns out, pretty expensive. That's one reason why expansion of Google Fiber's ambitious project to bring ultrafast internet to U.S. cities around has been placed on hold. The company has spent spent hundreds of millions of dollars laying fiber-optic cablesto bring Internet service as much as 100 times faster than average high-speed wireless to customers in six cities so far.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dcce7b95454b4897c414d753635d959b/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fd267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net%2Fi%2Fimages%2Fgooglefiber.png%3Fcx%3D0%26cy%3D3%26cw%3D1000%26ch%3D562%26sw%3D1200"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Flexible Sheet Turns Any Surface Into A 360-Degree Camera</h1><p>In Brief Researchers have developed a flexible "sheet camera" that can stick to any surface like wallpaper, making it possible to capture images from impossible angles. In the world of tomorrow, every surface will be a camera. Or at least, it seems that way.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/700ba22cc2d3a073cf68056eabb5e4b2/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=464&cropwidth=640&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Ffuturism.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F04%2Fflexible-sheet-camera-examples.jpg&x=96&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Audi's new technology is the beginning of the end of traffic lights</h1><p>Audi has announced it is rolling out a feature in some of its new vehicles that allows them to communicate with traffic lights. It's a neat trick that customers might like: they can watch as a timer counts down until a red light turns green, or the system can warn drivers approaching a green light that it's going to change, and advise them to start braking.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/00b06b11a199f47fca59d0d0b365afe5/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fd267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net%2Fi%2Fimages%2Ftraffic.lightsx1000.png%3Fcx%3D19%26cy%3D0%26cw%3D960%26ch%3D540%26sw%3D1200"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Livestream's Mevo camera lets you edit video on the fly</h1><p>My first thought upon hearing about the camera, which was officially introduced at Facebook's F8 conference earlier this week, was: Who exactly is Livestream targeting here? Facebook Live video has boomed in a big way with people shooting on their phones, and lots of those users aren't going to shell out for a $399 external camera.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4466be094e86bad9c0e2fe4c5a74c3d32ef5c016.jpg"></article>]]></description>

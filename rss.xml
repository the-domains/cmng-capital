            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Flexible Sheet Turns Any Surface Into A 360-Degree Camera</h1><p>In Brief Researchers have developed a flexible "sheet camera" that can stick to any surface like wallpaper, making it possible to capture images from impossible angles. In the world of tomorrow, every surface will be a camera. Or at least, it seems that way.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/700ba22cc2d3a073cf68056eabb5e4b2/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=464&cropwidth=640&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Ffuturism.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F04%2Fflexible-sheet-camera-examples.jpg&x=96&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Audi's new technology is the beginning of the end of traffic lights</h1><p>Audi has announced it is rolling out a feature in some of its new vehicles that allows them to communicate with traffic lights. It's a neat trick that customers might like: they can watch as a timer counts down until a red light turns green, or the system can warn drivers approaching a green light that it's going to change, and advise them to start braking.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/00b06b11a199f47fca59d0d0b365afe5/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fd267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net%2Fi%2Fimages%2Ftraffic.lightsx1000.png%3Fcx%3D19%26cy%3D0%26cw%3D960%26ch%3D540%26sw%3D1200"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Spotify's Design Lead on Why Side Projects Should Be Stupid</h1><p>Tobias van Schneider lives his life like one big side project. Today, he designs and builds new products for Spotify in New York, but he couldn't have predicted that when he dropped out of school at age 15 to work as an apprentice in a computer shop in Austria.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0cbe313da3d1b5606d1eafef39a6e06bb364cc71.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Livestream's Mevo camera lets you edit video on the fly</h1><p>My first thought upon hearing about the camera, which was officially introduced at Facebook's F8 conference earlier this week, was: Who exactly is Livestream targeting here? Facebook Live video has boomed in a big way with people shooting on their phones, and lots of those users aren't going to shell out for a $399 external camera.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4466be094e86bad9c0e2fe4c5a74c3d32ef5c016.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wearable Sun Protection</h1><p>There's no faster way to throw shade on a warm weather vacation (or the first few hot days of spring) than with sunburn. It takes only 15 minutes of direct sunlight exposure for skin damage to begin occurring, so protection is a must.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/02b678fdc35ac511ae64c114def378f383b690e1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
